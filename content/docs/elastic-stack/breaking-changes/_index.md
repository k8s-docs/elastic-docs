Before you upgrade, you must review the breaking changes for each product you use and make the necessary changes so your code is compatible with 7.8.1.

- APM 7.8.1 breaking changes
- Beats 7.8.1 breaking changes
- Elasticsearch 7.8.1 breaking changes
- Elasticsearch Hadoop 7.8.1 breaking changes
- Kibana 7.8.1 breaking changes
- Logstash 7.8.1 breaking changes

IMPORTANT

> - Make sure you check the breaking changes for each point release up to the desired new version.
> - If you’re upgrading from 5.n, make sure you check the breaking changes from 5.n to 6.n, as well as from 6.n to 7.n!
> - If you are using machine learning datafeeds that contain discontinued search or query domain specific language (DSL), the upgrade will fail. In 5.6.5 and later, the Upgrade Assistant provides information about which datafeeds need to be updated.
