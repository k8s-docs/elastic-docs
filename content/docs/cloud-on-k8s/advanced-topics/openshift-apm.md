Deploy an APM Server instance with a routeedit
It is currently not possible to run the APM Server with the restricted SCC. A possible workaround is to allow the Pod to run with the default uid 1000 by assigning it to the anyuid SCC:

Create a service account to run the APM Server

oc create serviceaccount apm-server -n elastic
Add the APM service account to the anyuid SCC

oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z apm-server -n elastic
scc "anyuid" added to: ["system:serviceaccount:elastic:apm-server"]
Deploy an APM Server and a route with the following manifest

cat <<EOF | oc apply -n elastic -f -
apiVersion: apm.k8s.elastic.co/v1
kind: ApmServer
metadata:
name: apm-server-sample

To check that the Pod of the APM Server is using the correct SCC, use the following command:

oc get pod -o go-template='{{range .items}}{{$scc := index .metadata.annotations "openshift.io/scc"}}{{.metadata.name}}{{" scc:"}}{{range .spec.containers}}{{$scc}}{{" "}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}{{end}}'
