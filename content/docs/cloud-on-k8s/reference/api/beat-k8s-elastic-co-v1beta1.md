| type               | string         | Type is the type of the Beat to deploy (filebeat, metricbeat, heartbeat, auditbeat, journalbeat, packetbeat, etc.). Any string can be used, but well-known types will have the image field defaulted and have the appropriate Elasticsearch roles created automatically. It also allows for dashboard setup when combined with a KibanaRef. |
| version            | string         | Version of the Beat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| elasticsearchRef   | ObjectSelector | ElasticsearchRef is a reference to an Elasticsearch cluster running in the same Kubernetes cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| kibanaRef          | ObjectSelector | KibanaRef is a reference to a Kibana instance running in the same Kubernetes cluster. It allows automatic setup of dashboards and visualizations.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| configRef          | ConfigSource   | ConfigRef contains a reference to an existing Kubernetes Secret holding the Beat configuration.

| secureSettings     | SecretSource   | SecureSettings is a list of references to Kubernetes Secrets containing sensitive configuration options for the Beat. Secrets data can be then referenced in the Beat config using the Secretâ€™s keys or as specified in Entries field of each SecureSetting.                                                                                |
| serviceAccountName | string         | ServiceAccountName is used to check access from the current resource to Elasticsearch resource in a different namespace. Can only be used if ECK is enforcing RBAC on references.                                                                                                                                                           |
| daemonSet          | DaemonSetSpec  | DaemonSet specifies the Beat should be deployed as a DaemonSet, and allows providing its spec. Cannot be used along with deployment. If both are absent a default for the Type is used.                                                                                                                                                     |
| deployment         | DeploymentSpec | Deployment specifies the Beat should be deployed as a Deployment, and allows providing its spec. Cannot be used along with daemonSet. If both are absent a default for the Type is used.                                                                                                                                                    |
